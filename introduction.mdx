## Setting up

To run Lavita AI Jobs, you need to first install the [Theta Edge Node](https://docs.thetatoken.org/docs/setup-theta-edge-node). After installing the Edge Node, go to **Settings**, enable **Lavita (AI/ML) Jobs**, and save your settings. Once saved, your device will start receiving AI jobs. See the picture below.

Once a job is completed, rewards remain unconfirmed until the job is processed and validated. Payouts exceeding the minimum threshold are batched and sent during the first week of the month. Currently, each node can run Lavita AI Jobs **every five hours**.
