Lavita AI’s [Medical Evaluation Sphere](https://assist.lavita.ai/evaluation) is the go-to platform for real-time evaluation of foundation models on any medical or clinical task, across any modality, at scale. We’re building a global network of medical professionals alongside a growing community of users to create the most trusted and comprehensive ecosystem for medical AI evaluation.

## How It Works

On the Medical Evaluation Sphere, users can chat with two foundation models and compare their performances. Everything starts with asking a question. Users can engage in either a **single-turn** or **multi-turn** conversation, then compare the responses from both models and vote on one of the following:

1. **Model A is better**

2. **Model B is better**

3. **It’s a tie** (both models performed well)

4. **Neither** (neither model provided a good response)

There are two modes of conversation on the Evaluation Sphere. By default, the models remain **anonymous** to ensure an objective comparison. However, users can choose to uncheck the **“Anonymous Battle”** option and manually select which models to compare—this is called a **non-anonymous battle**. In **anonymous battle mode**, after submitting a vote, the model names will be revealed.

<Note>When reporting results on our **leaderboard**, we only consider votes from anonymous battles. Additionally, while users can ask any type of question, we filter out votes on **non-medical or non-clinical** conversations when aggregating results. Therefore, we encourage users to focus on **medical questions**, as votes on non-medical topics will not be counted.</Note>
