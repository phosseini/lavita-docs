The Medical Sphere features a growing list of models that users can chat with **for free, without limitations**\! These models include both **general-purpose** and **medical** foundation models.

<Note>
  We **actively welcome new models** on our platform. If you have a model—or know of one—that you believe should be included in the Evaluation Sphere, please email us at [**sphere@lavita.ai**](mailto:sphere@lavita.ai) with a link to the model.
</Note>

<Note>
  We also welcome **partnerships and collaborations** with model providers interested in contributing to the open evaluation of medical and clinical models. Currently, we’re particularly looking for partners who can support the Medical Evaluation Sphere by providing **dedicated or serverless endpoints** for the growing list of models we are adding. If you're interested in partnering with us, please reach out at [**sphere@lavita.ai**](mailto:sphere@lavita.ai).
