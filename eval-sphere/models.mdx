title: 'Sphere Models'
---

The Medical Evaluation Sphere features a growing list of models that users can chat with **for free, without limitations**! These models include both **general-purpose** and **medical foundation** models. Below, you can find the full list of available models.

<Note>We **actively welcome new models** on our platform. If you have a model—or know of one—that you believe should be included in the Evaluation Sphere, please email us at **[tech@lavita.ai](mailto:tech@lavita.ai)** with a link to the model.</Note>

<Note>We also welcome **partnerships and collaborations** with model providers interested in contributing to the open evaluation of medical and clinical models. Currently, we’re particularly looking for partners who can support our Medical Evaluation Sphere by providing **dedicated or serverless endpoints** for the growing list of models we are adding. If you're interested in partnering with us, please reach out at **[tech@lavita.ai](mailto:tech@lavita.ai)**.</Note>
