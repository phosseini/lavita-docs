To run Lavita AI Jobs, you need to first install the [Theta Edge Node](https://docs.thetatoken.org/docs/setup-theta-edge-node). After installing the Edge Node, go to **Settings**, enable **Lavita (AI/ML) Jobs**, and save your settings. See the picture below. Once saved, your device will start receiving AI jobs.

Once a job is completed, rewards remain unconfirmed until the job is processed and validated. Payouts are batched and sent during the first week of each month. Currently, each node (wallet address) can run Lavita AI jobs **every five hours**.
