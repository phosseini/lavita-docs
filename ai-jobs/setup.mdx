To run Lavita AI Jobs, you need to first install the [Theta Edge Node](https://docs.thetatoken.org/docs/setup-theta-edge-node). After installing the Edge Node, go to **Settings**, enable **Lavita (AI/ML) Jobs**, and save your settings. See the picture below. Once saved, your device will start receiving AI jobs.

Once a job is completed, rewards remain unconfirmed until the job is processed and validated. Payouts are batched and sent during the first week of each month. Currently, each node (wallet address) can run Lavita AI jobs **every five hours**.

## Rewards

The reward amount depends on two factors:

* Whether the EN is using a GPU and the type of GPU itâ€™s using.

* Whether it is an **Elite Edge Node (EEN)**, meaning the EN owner has staked in this EN.

ENs that use a GPU for jobs and qualify as Elite Edge Nodes will receive higher rewards.
