To run Lavita AI Jobs, you need to first install the [Theta Edge Node](https://docs.thetatoken.org/docs/setup-theta-edge-node). After installing the Edge Node, go to **Settings**, enable **Lavita (AI/ML) Jobs**, and save your settings. See the picture below. Once saved, your device will start receiving AI jobs.

Once a job is completed, rewards remain unconfirmed until the job is processed and validated. Payouts are batched and sent during the first week of each month. Currently, each node (wallet address) can run Lavita AI jobs **every five hours**.

## Rewards Calculation

Your reward amount is based on two key factors:

1. **GPU Usage** – Whether your Edge Node (EN) is utilizing a GPU and the type of GPU in use.

2. **Elite Edge Node (EEN) Status** – If your EN qualifies as an Elite Edge Node (EEN), meaning you’ve staked in this EN, you earn additional rewards.

<Tip>ENs that both **use a GPU** and **qualify as an Elite Edge Node** receive **higher rewards**.</Tip>
