To run Lavita AI Jobs, you first need to install the [Theta Edge Node](https://docs.thetatoken.org/docs/setup-theta-edge-node). Once you launch the app, it will automatically create a wallet for new users, while existing users will be connected to their existing wallets. Now, go to **Settings**.

Enable **Lavita (AI/ML)**, and save your settings.

Once saved, your device will start receiving AI jobs.

Once a job is completed, rewards remain unconfirmed until the job is processed and validated.

<Note>Each node (wallet address) can run Lavita AI jobs **every five hours**. Payouts are batched and sent during the first week of each month.</Note>

## Rewards Calculation

Your reward amount is based on two key factors:

1. **GPU Usage** – Whether your Edge Node (EN) is utilizing a GPU and the type of GPU in use.

2. **Elite Edge Node (EEN) Status** – If your EN qualifies as an Elite Edge Node (EEN), meaning you’ve staked in this EN, you earn additional rewards.

<Tip>ENs that both **use a GPU** and **qualify as an Elite Edge Node** receive **higher rewards**.</Tip>
