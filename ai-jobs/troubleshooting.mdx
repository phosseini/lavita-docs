If you're not receiving any Lavita AI Jobs, it could be due to a few reasons.

## Check System Specifications

<Note>
  Currently, a machine with only a **CPU** and at least **16GB of RAM** should be able to receive and run AI Jobs without any issues, assuming there is a minimum amount of disk space (**preferably at least 10GB free**).
</Note>

If you're encountering errors or noticing that jobs are not completing, verify that your system meets these minimum requirements.
