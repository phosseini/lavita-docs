If you're not receiving any Lavita AI Jobs, it could be due to a few reasons.

## Check System Specifications

If you're encountering errors or noticing that jobs are not completing, verify that your system meets these minimum requirements.

<Note>
  A machine with only a **CPU** and at least **16GB of RAM** should be able to receive and run AI Jobs without any issues, assuming there is a minimum amount of disk space (**preferably at least 10GB free**).
</Note>


## Check Logs

To help us better understand the source of issues with your AI Jobs, in case of failure, find the following two logs:

- **`qa_main.log`**  
  This file contains logs for every step of running AI Jobs. You can check this file line by line to see what actually happens when your jobs are running. In case of failure, reviewing this file provides insights into where the issue might be. Below is a list of log steps recorded in this file.

- **`qa_progress.log`**  
  This file captures system logs, including [`stdout`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams) and [`stderr`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams). It helps display the progress of AI Jobs on the Edge Node UI while also catching error messages or diagnostics.
