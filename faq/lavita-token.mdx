  <Accordion title="How does LAVITA Cross Chain Transfer work?" icon="alien-8bit">
    If you send Lavita from your Edge Node to your wallet and see zero Lavita, it means the Edge Node sent it to its subchain in your wallet. To view it, you need to go to the Theta `mainnet` and click on **Cross Chain Transfer**.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/faq-token-transfer-1.png" />
    </Frame>

    From there, follow these steps:

    1. **Select chain:** LAVITA  
    2. **Asset:** TFUEL  
    3. **Amount:** At least **10 TFUEL** (this is the gas fee to send Lavita from its chain to Theta Mainnet)  

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/faq-token-transfer-2.png" />
    </Frame>

    Once you've completed this, go to Lavita Mainnet.

    <Frame>

    </Frame>

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/faq-token-transfer-4.png" />
    </Frame>

    Then:

    1. Ensure you have **at least 10 TFUEL** for gas fees.  
    2. Click on **Metachain**.  
    3. The **Destination chain** will automatically be set to **Main Chain**.  
    4. **Asset:** vLAVITA  
    5. **Amount:** Any amount you want to transfer. Keep in mind that each transaction requires at least **10 TFUEL + gas fees**.
